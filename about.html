    <h2 class="mb-4">About Us</h2>
    <p><strong>Basthi Ki Patashala</strong> is a grassroots non-profit initiative that brings free education, moral values, and cultural learning to children in underserved communities, especially slums ("basthis"). Founded by a team of passionate educators and social workers, our goal is to empower the next generation with wisdom, confidence, and compassion.</p>
    
    <p>Through evening and weekend classes, we help children develop not just literacy skills, but also leadership, discipline, and empathy. Our unique curriculum blends modern learning with timeless values — including storytelling, yoga, devotional music, arts, hygiene awareness, and community service.</p>
    
    <p>We believe that true upliftment begins where it's needed most — at the grassroots. Every child, regardless of background, deserves the opportunity to learn, grow, and dream big.</p>
    
    <p>With the help of our selfless volunteers, Basthi Ki Patashala now runs learning programs across multiple urban communities. And we're just getting started.</p>
